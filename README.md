# Clear OneDrive Files History Version

## Introduction
Because GoodSync will create an extra version when syncing the file modification time, resulting in repeated occupation of OneDrive space, so I need a tool to quickly clear the historical versions of all files.
Unfortunately OneDrive doesn't provide this feature, so I wrote a script to clear them.
